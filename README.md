# python-sales
This short project explores sales from a simulated retail data set using linear regressions.
First, the individual source files are combined into a relational database using MySQL.
Then, a few relationships are explored using linear regressions in the statsmodels package in Python: Total profit and number of orders by product category, order method (retail, wholesale, or online), and customer tier (bronze, silver, gold, etc).
